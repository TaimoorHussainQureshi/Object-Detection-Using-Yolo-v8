# An Introduction to YOLO v8

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the capabilities of YOLO v8 for object detection. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system, and version 8 brings several improvements and optimizations.

## Notebook Overview

- **Load the Model**: The notebook begins by loading both the detection and instance models of YOLO v8.
- **Run Inference**: We then run inference on an input image using both models to showcase their capabilities.
- **Results and Comparison**: The notebook includes a comparative analysis of the results from the detection and instance segmentation models. It highlights the differences between the bounding boxes provided by the object detection model and the detailed object pixels identified by the instance segmentation model.
- **Exploration**: Users are encouraged to explore the results, such as counting instances, examining labels, and bounding box coordinates for detected objects.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: [List here the main libraries used, such as TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.]

## Setup and Installation

Provide instructions on how to set up and run the notebook in a local environment.
